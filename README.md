# ComplexOps

This code I wrote for a task on stepik.org

## The task

Create a class implementing a complex number. The class must have 2 fields: for real part and for imaginary part. 
Declare 2 complex numbers and get their values form user.
Overload operators for:
- printing complex number in following format: Re + Im (4 + 5i);
- sum of two complex numbers
- difference between two complex numbers
- product of two complex numbers
- quotient of two complex numbers

## The scenario

- User inputs two complex nubers
- Pring sum, difference, product and quotient of the twwo numbers.
If one part of complex number equals zero, don't print it. If both parts equal zero - print 0. The answer needs to be rounded to second decimal.
